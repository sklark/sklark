### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Steve 

### I'm a Father, and an Engineer

I've been a techie my whole life.  I like Python, Go, and I'm liking Rust as well.  I'm a big fan of Kubernetes and orchestration.  I like to automate things, and I love solving new problems.

Fun Fact: The Mona Lisa has no eyebrows.
